# celtic-plaits
Herein is contained a Matlab program for drawing the links of 'Celtic plaits'. These can be informally defined as alternating knots that can be laid out on a rectangular grid. The code is a little confusing to read as it goes back and forth between several helper functions. See my project for more information about Celtic plaits and motivation for this program: http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/ImogenMorrisreport.pdf.

CplaitGUI is the main function and the one which produces the Celtic plait. Try calling CplaitGUI(2,3) for a 4x6 Celtic plait.
